ThoughtWall 
Brandon Hills ('20) and Allison Lee ('20) 
CS50 Fall 2016 Final Project
======================================================

ThoughtWall is a website meant to be a space for Harvard College undergraduates to express their ideas and get to know each other.
Users (after registering under a @college.harvard.edu email address) will be able to post content to various ThoughtWalls within the
website. Each user will have access to 4 ThoughtWalls: the general ThoughtWall (accessible to all Harvard College users), their 
year's ThoughtWall (accessible to only those in the user's graduation class), their house's ThoughtWall (accessible to only those in 
their house), and their concentration's ThoughtWall. For each post on a wall, the poster's email address and name are displayed so 
that users can contact each other easily. 

Features
=============
Users can: 
- Register an account, but only under an @college.harvard.edu email address 
- Post content (max. length 500 characters) to any wall the user can access
- Drag around and reorganize posts on a ThoughtWall in any order they would like 
- Change their personal account settings (house, concentration, password)
- Remove one's own previously created posts from any wall (listed as an option under the "Settings" tab)

How To Use*  
=============
- ThoughtWall has been created inside the CS50 IDE. 
- Just cd into finalproject, run Flask with the command "flask run", and select CS50 IDE > Web Server. 

* If this project became a permanent website, users would have access to the permanent URL (and contribute to the same 
database); however, our present implementation method will not result in users contributing to the same database, unless
they are working from a shared IDE.
